# Usage: powprox install
# Summary: Sets up Nginx -> Pow proxy and prepares SSL certificates
# Help: This is safe to run anytime. It'll pick up where it left off.
# It'll install Nginx (if it isn't already), set up Pow proxy config
# (if it isn't already, etcâ€¦), create a root certificate authority,
# trust it in the Keychain, generate an SSL cert for all Pow domains,
# and configure Nginx to run as root (to bind privileged ports 80 & 443).
